/*
 * Performs the flush operation on one or more indices.
 * For more info refers to https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/indices-flush.html
 *
 * @param index

 * @param errorTrace When set to `true` Elasticsearch will include the full stack trace of errors
 * when they occur.
 * @server_default false

 * @param filterPath Comma-separated list of filters in dot notation which reduce the response
 * returned by Elasticsearch.

 * @param human When set to `true` will return statistics in a format suitable for humans.
 * For example `"exists_time": "1h"` for humans and
 * `"eixsts_time_in_millis": 3600000` for computers. When disabled the human
 * readable values will be omitted. This makes sense for responses being consumed
 * only by machines.
 * @server_default false

 * @param pretty If set to `true` the returned JSON will be "pretty-formatted". Only use
 * this option for debugging only.
 * @server_default false

 * @param allowNoIndices Whether to ignore if a wildcard indices expression resolves into no concrete indices. (This includes `_all` string or when no indices have been specified)
 * @param expandWildcards Whether to expand wildcard expression to concrete indices that are open, closed or both.
 * @param force Whether a flush should be forced even if it is not necessarily needed ie. if no changes will be committed to the index. This is useful if transaction log IDs should be incremented even if no uncommitted changes are present. (This setting can be considered as internal)
 * @param ignoreUnavailable Whether specified concrete indices should be ignored when unavailable (missing or closed)
 * @param indices A comma-separated list of index names; use `_all` or empty string for all indices
 * @param waitIfOngoing If set to true the flush operation will block until the flush can be executed if another flush operation is already executing. The default is true. If set to false the flush will be skipped iff if another flush operation is already running.
