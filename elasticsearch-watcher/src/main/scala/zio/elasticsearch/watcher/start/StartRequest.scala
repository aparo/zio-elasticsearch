/*
 * Starts Watcher if it is not already running.
 * For more info refers to https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/watcher-api-start.html
 *
 * @param errorTrace When set to `true` Elasticsearch will include the full stack trace of errors
 * when they occur.
 * @server_default false

 * @param filterPath Comma-separated list of filters in dot notation which reduce the response
 * returned by Elasticsearch.

 * @param human When set to `true` will return statistics in a format suitable for humans.
 * For example `"exists_time": "1h"` for humans and
 * `"eixsts_time_in_millis": 3600000` for computers. When disabled the human
 * readable values will be omitted. This makes sense for responses being consumed
 * only by machines.
 * @server_default false

 * @param pretty If set to `true` the returned JSON will be "pretty-formatted". Only use
 * this option for debugging only.
 * @server_default false
