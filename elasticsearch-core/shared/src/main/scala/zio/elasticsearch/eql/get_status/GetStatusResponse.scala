/*
 * Returns the status of a previously submitted async or stored Event Query Language (EQL) search
 * For more info refers to https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/eql-search-api.html
 *
 * @param id Identifier for the search.

 * @param isPartial If true, the search request is still executing. If false, the search is completed.

 * @param isRunning If true, the response does not contain complete search results. This could be because either the search is still running (is_running status is false), or because it is already completed (is_running status is true) and results are partial due to failures or timeouts.

 * @param startTimeInMillis For a running search shows a timestamp when the eql search started, in milliseconds since the Unix epoch.

 * @param expirationTimeInMillis Shows a timestamp when the eql search will be expired, in milliseconds since the Unix epoch. When this time is reached, the search and its results are deleted, even if the search is still ongoing.

 * @param completionStatus For a completed search shows the http status code of the completed search.
