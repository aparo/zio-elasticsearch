/*
 * Closes one or more anomaly detection jobs. A job can be opened and closed multiple times throughout its lifecycle.
 * For more info refers to https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ml-close-job.html
 *
 * @param jobId The name of the job to close
 * @param errorTrace When set to `true` Elasticsearch will include the full stack trace of errors
 * when they occur.
 * @server_default false

 * @param filterPath Comma-separated list of filters in dot notation which reduce the response
 * returned by Elasticsearch.

 * @param human When set to `true` will return statistics in a format suitable for humans.
 * For example `"exists_time": "1h"` for humans and
 * `"eixsts_time_in_millis": 3600000` for computers. When disabled the human
 * readable values will be omitted. This makes sense for responses being consumed
 * only by machines.
 * @server_default false

 * @param pretty If set to `true` the returned JSON will be "pretty-formatted". Only use
 * this option for debugging only.
 * @server_default false

 * @param allowNoMatch Whether to ignore if a wildcard expression matches no jobs. (This includes `_all` string or when no jobs have been specified)
 * @param body body the body of the call
 * @param force True if the job should be forcefully closed
 * @param timeout Controls the time to wait until a job has closed. Default to 30 minutes
